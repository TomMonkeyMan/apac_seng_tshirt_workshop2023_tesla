# apac_seng_tshirt_workshop2023_tesla
this repo contains the midjourney generated design for workshop T-shirt.

Why am I using external Git instead of Tesla within Confluence or internal service? 
It's because I need to use Discord/Photoshop and send the pictures to a vendor for printing out. Tesla secure staff/logos are NOT included. Additionally, I want people to be able to review the pictures from anywhere, even if they cannot log in to Tesla SSO one day. So if you happen to be an infosec person seeing this, please don't judge me.


#### raw pictures generated by MidJ

We will manually modify the text and details later(such as the accuracy of the Tesla car's "T" logo) using Photoshop in the future
